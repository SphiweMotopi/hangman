# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game, a classic word-guessing game built with React!

## Rules of the Game

In Hangman, you have to guess a secret word one letter at a time. The game provides you with a limited number of incorrect guesses before you lose. Here are the basic rules:

1. A random word will be selected as the secret word from a predefined list.
2. You need to guess the letters of the secret word.
3. Each correct guess reveals the position of the guessed letter in the word.
4. Each incorrect guess brings you closer to losing the game.
5. You win if you correctly guess all the letters in the word before running out of incorrect guesses.
6. You lose if you reach the maximum allowed incorrect guesses or if you make an incorrect guess after guessing the entire word.
